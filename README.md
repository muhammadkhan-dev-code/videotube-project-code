## Project Overview

This is the backend for the Videotube project, built with Node.js and Express.

Progress so far: the backend core is implemented â€” an Express app with a MongoDB connection, a `User` model that hashes passwords and provides token helpers, and a registration flow (`POST /api/v1/users/register`) that accepts multipart/form-data (text fields and avatar/cover image uploads) using multer. Uploaded files are stored temporarily and then uploaded to Cloudinary via a utility; the controller includes basic validation and duplicate-user checks. A few common errors (missing `app` import, missing password field, and 409 conflicts on duplicate users) were discovered and documented for debugging.
